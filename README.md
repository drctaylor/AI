# Computer Vision Initial Programming

File: Ps0.py Computer Vision Initilization code

This file works to manipulate two images.  You can use any image you like. It is currently set to Woman.png and Firefly.png  It is set up for Python 3.  The input files have four images and the output file shows the solution for each image manipulation.

Setup: Running the file, takes two images from the input file and writes out 21 images to the output file.
Step 1: Load Images
Step 2: Change the Red to Blue Pixels on the color planes for each image
Step 3: Replacement Pixels - replace a square in one image to another
Step 4: Take statistics of a picture and and change pixel value
Step 5: Add noise to the images

Input: 2 Png images
Requirements: rectangular images, less than 512 pixels in any direction. Works best if they are images that are rectangular in different directions

Output: Save the image files to an output file for each pixel manipulation. Each step is documented in the code

This is a timed coding challenge from Kata Stats https://www.codewars.com/kata/sum-of-pairs

Setup: You can only run the file. It will go through the Kata challenge to make mixed pairs

Input: The file sums different numbers within a list. Running the file as is, will show answers to the following:
print(sum_pairs([11, 3, 7, 5],        10))
print(sum_pairs([4, 3, 2, 3, 4],       6))
print(sum_pairs([0, 0, -2, 3],         2))
print(sum_pairs([10, 5, 2, 3, 7, 5],  10))

You can change those numbers to test out of the function as desiered.

Output: Displays the numbered pairs that sum to your request
